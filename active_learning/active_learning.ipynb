    "A recap of some active learning techniques:\n",
    "1. _Bias towards uncertanty_: certain models directly output the prediction uncertainty. I should gather those which I'm least certain about.\n",
    "2. _Bias towards ensemble disagreement_: when using ensemble methods, I should focus on those samples that present the highest disagrement.\n",
    "3. _Bias towards labels most likely to influence my classifier_: if I have a similarity measure between samples, I could pick those that are more disimilar (i.e. they have features that I haven't seen before).\n",
    "\n",
    "If I apply the previous strategies, it is likely that I'm gonna end up having outliers (very strange samples). I should be aware of that and try to _bias towards denser regions of training data_.\n",
